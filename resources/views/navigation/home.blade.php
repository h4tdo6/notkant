He was the fourth of nine children in a pious but unpretentious family. His parents, especially his mother, had a strong effect on his sense of discipline and morality. Kant went to the Collegium Fridericianum, where he studied classical languages, and later entered the University of KÃ¶nigsberg (Albertina) to study philosophy, mathematics, and the natural sciences. <br><br>Career as Academician: 1740-1770 <br> Upon his father's death, Kant spent nearly a decade as a private tutor before re-entering academia. He received his doctorate in 1755 and started teaching at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg. He was shaped by rationalist philosophers such as Leibniz and Wolff, but also empiricists including Hume and Newton during this period.</div><div class='mt-3 text-blue-500'>#philosophy #portrait #kÃ¶nigsberg #prussia #critique</div>",

To neglect these duties would be to undermine one's own humanity.</div><div class='mt-3 text-blue-500'>#duty #selfrespect #humanity #moralobligation #philosophy</div>",

Thus, the pursuit of moral perfection requires a constant effort to strengthen our will and cultivate virtue.</div><div class='mt-3 text-blue-500'>#moralperfection #progress #virtue #ethics #philosophy</div>",

Moral feeling is the innate sense of respect we experience when we recognize the authority of the moral law. It is not derived from external influence or personal interest but arises naturally from our rational nature. This feeling of respect acts as a motivating force, encouraging us to act from duty rather than inclination.</div><div class='mt-3 text-blue-500'>#moralfeeling #conscience #respect #duty #philosophy</div>",
